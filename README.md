# AntLog
An app to help you determine which racing ant is most likely to win. (It's probably Big Susan...)

## Install Expo Go

To run the AntLog on your phone you will need to install the Expo Go app.

iPhone - [Expo Go for iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)

Android - [Expo Go for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www)

## Download the Project

Clone down this repo and cd into the cloned copy.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Brechy/AntLog.git
cd AntLog
yarn install
```

## Run the Project

```bash
yarn start
```
This should display a large QR code in your terminal along with instructions "Scan the QR code above with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS)".
If you happen to have XCode installed already, you can use the options for opening an emulator for iPhone or Android, however the Expo Go app makes the
demo process a little easier. :)

##Now go check out those ants!
